# ExtendedBrowser
Built by Amber Feng, Alexander Wong, Timothy Yung, and Jonathan Mui

ExtendedBrowser is a browser based software built to simulate “multiple, extended monitors”, allowing users to visually drag items across the span of multiple browsers. We built this in 18 hours for the Zynga Hackathon 2010 here at UC Berkeley and won *2nd place*!

*Note: This codebase is EXTREMELY out of date.
